# Facial Recognition on Jetson Nano


Augmented reality (AR) enhances the real-world environment. For example, a furniture company could allow customers to visualize how a sofa would look in their living room so they know before they buy it. Using a smartphone camera, customers can place the sofa virtually and make a decision from here. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.” Computer vision describes the process of using digital images and videos to gain stronger insights from users. Information from data sources is extracted automatically, analyzed, and understood. In recent years, it has been used for medical image analysis, facial recognition, surveillance, pollution monitoring, and other highly advanced systems.
